The code collects compound name from the user, processes the input to remove extra spaces, and saves a DataFrame to a CSV file.

Code Explanation

Imports:

import requests(A library for making HTTP requests to fetch data from web APIs.)

import pandas as pd(A powerful data manipulation and analysis library, often used for handling structured data.) from urllib.parse import quote

(quote: A function from urllib.parse used for URL encoding, which ensures that special characters in URLs are properly formatted.)

User Input:

compound_names = input("Enter compound names separated by commas: ").split(",")

This line prompts the user to enter compound names as a comma-separated string.

The split(",") method divides the string into a list of names based on the commas. Stripping Whitespace: compound_names = [name.strip() for name in compound_names] This list comprehension iterates over each compound name and removes any leading or trailing whitespace using strip(). Saving to CSV: df.to_csv("compound_properties_by_name.csv", index=False) This line saves a DataFrame df (which is assumed to be defined earlier in the code) to a CSV file named "compound_properties_by_name.csv". The index=False parameter prevents pandas from writing row indices to the CSV file.
